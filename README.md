Breakout for the PSoC CY8CKIT-049 and the MQ-3 alcohol gas sensor with LED's representing ADC values.

##Purpose
All one needs for this is batteries, a 5V linear regulator (LDO), and LEDs plus matching resistors, and
the MQ-3 alcohol gas sensor. The MCU that runs this is the Cypress CY8CKIT-049, which just happens to be around
